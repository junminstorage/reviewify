She (daughter) loves it best lab top ever bought..


Absolutely love this MacBook Pro - it's this only one with a built in cd / DVD drive. It's the best computer I've ever used. Even though there's an Apple Store in Charleston, I chose to go with Best Buy because of the fantastic customer service!! Love the computer and the store!

This computer is the best computer for a college student in graphic design.


Great for my first laptop. I am able to download my entire music collection.




Bought for the wife who has to have an Apple computer. Got more features for half the money with the HP's I bought for my daughters. Great build quality.



Good item , as expected, met my expectations........




I have acquired several products from Best Buy, and I am very satisfied with the quality and the service.




This is my first macbook ever purchased. I had some hesitations getting this one since the newer model came out. However, I am very satisfied with this one since I don't do any video/photo/music editing on it. As of right now this is just for school and casual web browsing and it is perfect for that. AND it was cheaper than the newer model as well. Sure, this one is not as "good" as the new one but it works for what I have to do.
It does get a little slow from time to time but it's not much of an issue for me. If it ever gets to the point where I can't take the lag, I may just upgrade the RAM and switch the HDD to an SSD.
