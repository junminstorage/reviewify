I am writing this review after using it for around 6 months. It worked fine for 4 months. After that the screen started flickering and I had to forcibly shutdown the laptop with power button. I then upgraded to Mac OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion". The problem seemed to be resolved. But once I started trying to upgrade to Maverics, as soon as I open iTunes to download the new OS the screen started flickering again for few seconds and screen goes grey. I had to press the power button. And when I come back and open the iTunes again, same problem comes. Not sure if it is a s/w or h/w issue. I am no longer in US to even go to the store for any replacement of warranty stuff. I spent a lot of money on it hoping that I would enjoy by buy. btw, I didn't use this laptop much as I go to work and come back late at night.
